  itemName: Robot'sRightHand
  description: The right hand of an assault robot that fled to the Gungeon. When
    wielded by the Robot, combines with Junk to increase all damage output. It is
    a simple projectile delivery system. Reliable, but its short barrel is lacking
    in intricacy. Under the control of a targeting AI it becomes fearsome indeed.
