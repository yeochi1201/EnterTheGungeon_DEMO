  description: This Budget Revolver was brought to the Gungeon by an infamous fugitive.
    Provided by the Hegemony Regional Magistrate. The Convict won their plea to face
    the Gungeon in lieu of life imprisonment; undo their crimes, or face an eternity
    in the Gungeon. With no cost to the state, it was an acceptable arrangement. 
    Cheaply made and prone to jams, the Budget Revolver is used by only the most
    desperate Gungeoneers.
