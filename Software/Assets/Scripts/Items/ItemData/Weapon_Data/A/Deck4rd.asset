  description: Fires massive explosive rounds. Following the tragic Ten Days' War,
    a majority of the Hegemony's Shock Troops were decommissioned. A small number
    of the combat robots escaped however, and they were pursued relentlessly by special
    forces. This explosive hand cannon belonged to one such detective who tracked
    his prey to the Gungeon.
