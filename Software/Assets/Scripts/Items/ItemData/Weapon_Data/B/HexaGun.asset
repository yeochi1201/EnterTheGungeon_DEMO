  description: The Hexagun was created by a vengeful Gunjurer after his apprentices
    were slain by a Gungeoneer wielding the humble Bundle of Wands. The stock is
    formed from what was once his staff, and each piece of metal was enchanted thrice
    before assembly. His revenge came swiftly, and from a great distance.
